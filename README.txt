This is a little program that will take a .NES rom file and analyse it's header and then report the information back to the user.
It'll show you the size of the PRG and CHR roms, if a rom has Battery Backed Ram or other persistant memory, if it is hard wired for a horizontal or vertical configuration and mapper number
Compile it with gcc, or make and it should work, as it just uses the standard libraries.
